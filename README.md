# RayCasterOpenGL (CPU CASTING)
3D ray casting engine written using GLSL shader code. This version does all ray casting calculations on the CPU and renders using OpenGL. Slower than master branch in which ray casting is done in the shader but faster than NoOpenGL branch. This branch also supports sprites where the GPU ray casting branch cannot.
